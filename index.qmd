# Executive Summary

## Overview

This report investigates workplace injury patterns across office and non-office environments in the United States, focusing on financial impacts and regional trends to provide insights that can inform workplace safety strategies and policy development. Using data from national sources covering workplace injuries from 2019 to 2023, injuries were classified into Office and Non-Office categories based on their typical settings, and analyzed to compare their relative costs and causes. A key objective of this study is to examine how injury types and costs vary between office and non-office environments, and to assess whether regional disparities exist in injury rates across U.S. states.

## Methodology

Statistical analyses, including t-tests, ANOVA, and correlation analysis, were conducted to evaluate differences in injury costs, variations in regional injury rates, and the relationship between injury volumes and rates.

## Key Findings

The analysis indicates that non-office environments contribute a greater proportion of total injury costs (30.81%) compared to office environments (23.88%). Office-related injuries, though less frequent, tend to involve same-level falls and may carry higher costs per incident. In contrast, non-office injuries are primarily caused by falls to lower levels (9.78%) and being struck by objects (9.56%).

Regional injury rates vary across states, with Maine reporting the highest rate and Colorado the lowest. However, no clear patterns were identified at the regional level or in the relationship between injury case volume and injury rates.\

## Conclusion and Recommendations

While non-office settings contribute more to total injury costs, office-related injuries may be disproportionately costly on a per-incident basis. As such, targeted injury prevention strategies should be prioritized in office environments, particularly those aimed at reducing fall-related incidents. Additionally, localized safety assessments are recommended to better address injury risks at the state and regional levels, even in the absence of clear regional trends.
