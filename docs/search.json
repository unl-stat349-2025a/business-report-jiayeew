    "text": "D Introduction\nIn 2023, Amazon was fined $7,000 by OSHA following the death of a warehouse worker linked to unsafe conditions Staff and Bebout (2023). The company also faced a $60,000 penalty for exposing employees to additional hazards Palmer (2023), and has been the subject of over 50 OSHA investigations since 2020, with fines totaling more than $6 million “Amazon Is Fined Nearly $6 Million Over Warehouse Work Quotas - The New York Times” (n.d.). These incidents emphasize the real costs of workplace injuries, where employers face not only human tragedy but also legal liability and reputational damage. Nationally, U.S. businesses lose an estimated $167 billion annually due to workplace injuries “Work Injury Costs” (n.d.).\nWhile industrial settings often dominate safety conversations, office environments are frequently overlooked, despite accounting for 23.9% of preventable injury costs. This report explores whether office workers face greater injury risks than non-office workers, particularly in terms of injury frequency and cost. Using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, I analyzed injury trends across workplace types and regions, identifying the most costly injury types, and examining where injury rates are highest.\nFindings revealed that while non-office settings have higher overall injury rates, office environments experience a disproportionate share of same-level falls, responsible for 17.2% of total injury costs. These results suggest that companies should reallocate safety resources toward office settings, possibly reducing liability exposure and overall costs despite common assumptions that non-office settings are riskier.",

    "text": "B.1 Comparing Injury Costs Between Office and Non-Office Environments\nAn analysis of workplace injury data reveals that office environments contribute for (23.88%) of total workplace injury costs, with same-level falls (17.21%) being the leading cause of injuries in office settings. In contrast, non-office environments represent a larger share of injury costs at (30.81%), primarily due to falls to lower levels (9.78%) and being struck by objects (9.56%).\nTo determine whether these differences in injury cost proportions are statistically significant, I conducted a two-sample t-test. The results showed no significant difference between office and non-office environments, t(2.40) = 0.37, p = 0.74. lthough office environments had a higher average injury cost proportion (M = 7.96%, SD = 8.04) compared to non-office environments (M = 6.16%, SD = 3.26), the 95% confidence interval [-16.11, 19.71] includes zero, suggesting that the observed difference could be due to random chance and is not statistically significant.\nFigure 1: Causes of Workplace Injuries\nFigure 1 illustrates that office-related falls contribute more than twice the costs of non-office falls (21.23% vs. 9.78%). This is consistent with the data presented in Table 1, which breaks down injury costs by cause and environment:\nTable 1: Breakdown of Injury Costs by Cause and Work Environment.\n\n\nInjury Cause\n% of Costs\nEnvironment\n\n\n\n\nFalls on same level\n17.21\nOffice\n\n\nFalls to lower level\n9.78\nNon-Office\n\n\nStruck by object or equipment\n9.56\nNon-Office\n\n\nRoadway incidents\n4.76\nNon-Office\n\n\nSlip or trip without fall\n4.02\nOffice\n\n\nCaught in equipment\n3.54\nNon-Office\n\n\nStruck against object\n3.17\nNon-Office\n\n\nRepetitive motions\n2.65\nOffice\nFalls, particularly same-level falls and slips in office environments, contribute significantly to injury costs. Office-related falls account for 21.23% of fall-related injury costs, compared to just 9.78% for non-office falls. This highlights the financial impact of seemingly minor but frequent office accidents.\nTable 2: Fall-Related Injury Costs by Work Environment\n\n\nEnvironment\nTotal % of Costs\nProportion of Falls (%)\n\n\n\n\nNon-Office\n9.78\n31.54\n\n\nOffice\n21.23\n68.46\nTable 2 further illustrates that office environments contribute a larger proportion (68.46%) of fall-related injury costs, despite non-office environments accounting for a greater share of total injury costs.\nTable 3: Injury Cost Distribution by Work Environment\n\n\nEnvironment\nTotal %\nAverage % per Cause\nProportion of Total (%)\n\n\n\n\nNon-Office\n30.81\n6.16\n56.34\n\n\nOffice\n23.88\n7.96\n43.66\nTable 3 summarizes the overall distribution of injury costs by work environment. While non-office environments account for a larger share of total injury costs (30.81%), office environments have a higher average cost per injury cause (7.96% vs. 6.16%). This suggests that although injuries in office settings may occur less frequently, they tend to be more expensive on a per-cause basis.",

    "text": "B.2 Regional and State-Level Injury Trends\nWorkplace injury rates shows significant geographic variation across the United States. The Midwest reports the highest injury rate at 82.12 per 100 workers, which may be due to the region’s concentration of labor-intensive industries. In contrast, the south has the lowest rate at 67.64 per 100 workers, possibly reflecting stronger workplace safety regulations or a higher proportion of office-based jobs.\nWhile injury rates vary across regions, a one-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences in injury rates (p = 0.168), suggesting that regional variations in injury rates are not substantial enough to impact injury rates in a statistically meaningful way.\nI also conducted a Pearson correlation between total injury case volume and injury rates by state.

    "text": "This report analyzes workplace injury costs and trends across office and non-office environments, focusing on their financial impact and regional variations. The analysis examines the proportion of total injury costs attributed to each environment and identifies the leading causes of injury in both settings. Additionally, regional differences in injury rates are explored, along with the relationship between injury case volume and injury rates by state.\nThe results indicate that non-office environments contribute a greater share of injury costs (30.81%) compared to office environments (23.88%). The office injuries are primarily due to same-level falls, while non-office injuries are mainly caused by falls to lower levels (9.78%) and being struck by objects (9.56%). Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in injury cost proportions between the two environments. Regional injury rates vary, but ANOVA results (p = 0.168) showed no statistically significant differences. Maine (116.3 per 100 workers) has the highest state-level injury rate, while Colorado (5.5 per 100 workers) has the lowest. Correlation analysis (r = -0.09, p = 0.553) showed no significant correlation between injury case volume and injury rates at the state level.\nThese results suggest that while non-office environments account for higher total injury costs, office-related injuries may be disproportionately expensive per incident. Addressing the cost impact of office-related injuries and examining regional variations in injury rates could provide guidance for improving workplace safety policies.\nIn conclusion, this report highlights the need for targeted injury prevention strategies, especially in office environments, and calls for further investigation into regional safety practices to reduce disparities in injury rates.",
