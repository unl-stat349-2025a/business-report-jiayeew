    "text": "C Introduction\nIn 2023, Amazon was fined $7,000 by OSHA following the death of a warehouse worker linked to unsafe conditions Staff and Bebout (2023). The company also faced a $60,000 penalty for exposing employees to additional hazards Palmer (2023), and has been the subject of over 50 OSHA investigations since 2020, with fines totaling more than $6 million “Amazon Is Fined Nearly $6 Million Over Warehouse Work Quotas - The New York Times” (2024). These incidents emphasize the real costs of workplace injuries, where employers face not only human tragedy but also legal liability and reputational damage. Nationally, U.S. businesses lose an estimated $167 billion annually due to workplace injuries “Work Injury Costs” (2025).\nWhile industrial settings often dominate safety conversations, office environments are frequently overlooked, despite accounting for 23.9% of preventable injury costs. This report explores whether office workers face greater injury risks than non-office workers, particularly in terms of injury frequency and cost. Using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, I analyzed injury trends across workplace types and regions, identifying the most costly injury types, and examining where injury rates are highest.\nFindings revealed that while non-office settings have higher overall injury rates, office environments experience a disproportionate share of same-level falls, responsible for 17.2% of total injury costs.

    "text": "D.1 Comparing Injury Costs Between Office and Non-Office Environments\nAn analysis of workplace injury data reveals that office environments contribute for (23.88%) of total workplace injury costs, with same-level falls (17.21%) being the leading cause of injuries in office settings. In contrast, non-office environments represent a larger share of injury costs at (30.81%), primarily due to falls to lower levels (9.78%) and being struck by objects (9.56%).\nTo determine whether these differences in injury cost proportions are statistically significant, I conducted a two-sample t-test. The results showed no significant difference between office and non-office environments, t(2.40) = 0.37, p = 0.74. lthough office environments had a higher average injury cost proportion (M = 7.96%, SD = 8.04) compared to non-office environments (M = 6.16%, SD = 3.26), the 95% confidence interval [-16.11, 19.71] includes zero, suggesting that the observed difference could be due to random chance and is not statistically significant.\nFigure 1: Causes of Workplace Injuries\nFigure 1 illustrates that office-related falls contribute more than twice the costs of non-office falls (21.23% vs. 9.78%). This is consistent with the data presented in Table 1, which breaks down injury costs by cause and environment:\nTable 1: Breakdown of Injury Costs by Cause and Work Environment.\n\n\nInjury Cause\n% of Costs\nEnvironment\n\n\n\n\nFalls on same level\n17.21\nOffice\n\n\nFalls to lower level\n9.78\nNon-Office\n\n\nStruck by object or equipment\n9.56\nNon-Office\n\n\nRoadway incidents\n4.76\nNon-Office\n\n\nSlip or trip without fall\n4.02\nOffice\n\n\nCaught in equipment\n3.54\nNon-Office\n\n\nStruck against object\n3.17\nNon-Office\n\n\nRepetitive motions\n2.65\nOffice\nFalls, particularly same-level falls and slips in office environments, contribute significantly to injury costs. Office-related falls account for 21.23% of fall-related injury costs, compared to just 9.78% for non-office falls. This highlights the financial impact of seemingly minor but frequent office accidents.\nTable 2: Fall-Related Injury Costs by Work Environment\n\n\nEnvironment\nTotal % of Costs\nProportion of Falls (%)\n\n\n\n\nNon-Office\n9.78\n31.54\n\n\nOffice\n21.23\n68.46\nTable 2 further illustrates that office environments contribute a larger proportion (68.46%) of fall-related injury costs, despite non-office environments accounting for a greater share of total injury costs.\nTable 3: Injury Cost Distribution by Work Environment\n\n\nEnvironment\nTotal %\nAverage % per Cause\nProportion of Total (%)\n\n\n\n\nNon-Office\n30.81\n6.16\n56.34\n\n\nOffice\n23.88\n7.96\n43.66\nTable 3 summarizes the overall distribution of injury costs by work environment. While non-office environments account for a larger share of total injury costs (30.81%), office environments have a higher average cost per injury cause (7.96% vs. 6.16%). This suggests that although injuries in office settings may occur less frequently, they tend to be more expensive on a per-cause basis.",

    "text": "D.2 Regional and State-Level Injury Trends\nWorkplace injury rates shows significant geographic variation across the United States. The Midwest reports the highest injury rate at 82.12 per 100 workers, which may be due to the region’s concentration of labor-intensive industries. In contrast, the south has the lowest rate at 67.64 per 100 workers, possibly reflecting stronger workplace safety regulations or a higher proportion of office-based jobs.\nWhile injury rates vary across regions, a one-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences in injury rates (p = 0.168), suggesting that regional variations in injury rates are not substantial enough to impact injury rates in a statistically meaningful way.\nI also conducted a Pearson correlation between total injury case volume and injury rates by state.

    "text": "4.1 Comparing Injury Costs Between Office and Non-Office Environments\nAn analysis of workplace injury data reveals that office environments contribute for (23.88%) of total workplace injury costs, with same-level falls (17.21%) being the leading cause of injuries in office settings. In contrast, non-office environments represent a larger share of injury costs at (30.81%), primarily due to falls to lower levels (9.78%) and being struck by objects (9.56%).\nTo determine whether these differences in injury cost proportions are statistically significant, I conducted a two-sample t-test. The results showed no significant difference between office and non-office environments, t(2.40) = 0.37, p = 0.74. lthough office environments had a higher average injury cost proportion (M = 7.96%, SD = 8.04) compared to non-office environments (M = 6.16%, SD = 3.26), the 95% confidence interval [-16.11, 19.71] includes zero, suggesting that the observed difference could be due to random chance and is not statistically significant.\nFigure 1: Causes of Workplace Injuries\nFigure 1 illustrates that office-related falls contribute more than twice the costs of non-office falls (21.23% vs. 9.78%). This is consistent with the data presented in Table 1, which breaks down injury costs by cause and environment:\nTable 1: Breakdown of Injury Costs by Cause and Work Environment.\n\n\nInjury Cause\n% of Costs\nEnvironment\n\n\n\n\nFalls on same level\n17.21\nOffice\n\n\nFalls to lower level\n9.78\nNon-Office\n\n\nStruck by object or equipment\n9.56\nNon-Office\n\n\nRoadway incidents\n4.76\nNon-Office\n\n\nSlip or trip without fall\n4.02\nOffice\n\n\nCaught in equipment\n3.54\nNon-Office\n\n\nStruck against object\n3.17\nNon-Office\n\n\nRepetitive motions\n2.65\nOffice\nFalls, particularly same-level falls and slips in office environments, contribute significantly to injury costs. Office-related falls account for 21.23% of fall-related injury costs, compared to just 9.78% for non-office falls. This highlights the financial impact of seemingly minor but frequent office accidents.\nTable 2: Fall-Related Injury Costs by Work Environment\n\n\nEnvironment\nTotal % of Costs\nProportion of Falls (%)\n\n\n\n\nNon-Office\n9.78\n31.54\n\n\nOffice\n21.23\n68.46\nTable 2 further illustrates that office environments contribute a larger proportion (68.46%) of fall-related injury costs, despite non-office environments accounting for a greater share of total injury costs.\nTable 3: Injury Cost Distribution by Work Environment\n\n\nEnvironment\nTotal %\nAverage % per Cause\nProportion of Total (%)\n\n\n\n\nNon-Office\n30.81\n6.16\n56.34\n\n\nOffice\n23.88\n7.96\n43.66\nTable 3 summarizes the overall distribution of injury costs by work environment. While non-office environments account for a larger share of total injury costs (30.81%), office environments have a higher average cost per injury cause (7.96% vs. 6.16%). This suggests that although injuries in office settings may occur less frequently, they tend to be more expensive on a per-cause basis.",

    "text": "4.2 Regional and State-Level Injury Trends\nWorkplace injury rates shows significant geographic variation across the United States. The Midwest reports the highest injury rate at 82.12 per 100 workers, which may be due to the region’s concentration of labor-intensive industries. In contrast, the south has the lowest rate at 67.64 per 100 workers, possibly reflecting stronger workplace safety regulations or a higher proportion of office-based jobs.\nWhile injury rates vary across regions, a one-way ANOVA revealed no statistically significant differences in injury rates (p = 0.168), suggesting that regional variations in injury rates are not substantial enough to impact injury rates in a statistically meaningful way.\nI also conducted a Pearson correlation between total injury case volume and injury rates by state. The analysis found no significant correlation (r = -0.09, p = 0.553), indicating that states with higher total injury case volumes do not necessarily experience higher injury rates per 100 workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Comparison of Workplace Injury Rates Across Different States\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 illustrates that the Midwest has both the highest median and the most variable injury rates across regions.\n\n\n\nTable 4: Workplace Injury Rates by Region\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegion\nAverage Rate\nMedian Rate\nNumber of States\nTotal Injuries (Thousands)\n\n\n\n\nMidwest\n82.12\n81.80\n12\n17559.2\n\n\nNortheast\n78.41\n76.35\n8\n14637.4\n\n\nWest\n76.28\n79.00\n12\n15210.3\n\n\nSouth\n67.64\n69.20\n15\n24878.8\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the state level, Maine has the highest injury rate at 116.3 per 100 workers more than 20 times higher than Colorado’s rate of 5.5 per 100 workers, which is the lowest.
