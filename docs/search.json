    "text": "Preface\nYou are a data scientist for a mid-sized business, in a small group of 3-4 data scientists. You’ve been tasked with creating a report evaluating a scenario for your business. Your colleagues will also be evaluating the same scenario, and your reports will be used in aggregate to determine a consensus (or lack thereof) on the company’s action. The reports will also be used to inform downsizing that is rumored to be coming - you want to ensure your report is better than your peers so that you aren’t as easy to cut.\nYou may talk to your peers who are assigned the same scenario, but you do not want to collaborate too closely, lest you both become targets of the rumored layoffs.\n\nI’ve scaffolded this report for you to make this process easier - as we talk about different sections of a report in class and read about how to create similar sections, you will practice by writing the equivalent section of your report.\nThe basic steps for this task are as follows:\n\nIdentify the research question from the business question\nIdentify data set(s) which are (1) publicly available (you don’t have a budget to pay for private data) and (2) relevant to your task\n\n(HW Week 6) Document your data sets in draft-data-doc.qmd\n\nConduct a statistical analysis to support your answer to your research and business questions\n\nWrite a methods section for your business report corresponding to your statistical analysis\n(HW Week 9) Draft of results section of business report with relevant graphics/visual aids in draft-results.qmd\n\nWrite your report\n\n(HW Week 10) Draft of Intro/Conclusion sections in draft-intro-conclusions.qmd\n(HW Week 11) Draft of Executive summary section in draft-exec-summary.qmd\n\nRevise your report\n\n(HW Week 12 – not turned in) Revise your report\n(HW Week 13) - Rough draft of report due. Create one or more qmd files for your report (you can overwrite or delete intro.qmd and summary.qmd), include the names of each file (in order) in _quarto.yml. You should use references (edit references.bib and use pandoc citations). Make sure your report compiles and looks reasonable in both html and pdf.\nDevelop a presentation to go along with your report (Week 13). Create slides for your report using quarto.\n\nPeer revise reports\n\nPeer revise reports\n(HW Week 14) - Make edits to your report from comments received from peer review\n\nFinal report & presentation due",

    "text": "D Introduction\nIn 2023, Amazon was fined $7,000 by OSHA following the death of a warehouse worker linked to unsafe conditions ((StaffFortWayneAmazon?)). The company also faced a $60,000 penalty for exposing employees to additional hazards ((PalmerAmazonCitedLabor?)), and has been the subject of over 50 OSHA investigations since 2020, with fines totaling more than $6 million (“Amazon Is Fined Nearly $6 Million Over Warehouse Work Quotas - The New York Times” (n.d.)). These incidents emphasize the real costs of workplace injuries, where employers face not only human tragedy but also legal liability and reputational damage. Nationally, U.S. businesses lose an estimated $167 billion annually due to workplace injuries (“Work Injury Costs” (n.d.)).\nWhile industrial settings often dominate safety conversations, office environments are frequently overlooked, despite accounting for 23.9% of preventable injury costs. This report explores whether office workers face greater injury risks than non-office workers, particularly in terms of injury frequency and cost. Using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, I analyzed injury trends across workplace types and regions, identifying the most costly injury types, and examining where injury rates are highest.\nFindings revealed that while non-office settings have higher overall injury rates, office environments experience a disproportionate share of same-level falls, responsible for 17.2% of total injury costs. These results suggest that companies should reallocate safety resources toward office settings, possibly reducing liability exposure and overall costs despite common assumptions that non-office settings are riskier.",

    "text": "B.1 Workplace Injury Costs by Cause and Environment\nAn analysis of workplace injury data reveals that office environments contribute 23.9% of total workplace injury costs, with same-level falls (17.2%) as the leading cause. In contrast, non-office settings account for a larger share (30.8%) of injury costs, primarily due to falls to lower levels (9.8%) and being struck by objects (9.6%).\nGeographically, workplace injury rates vary significantly. The Midwest reports the highest injury rate (82.1 per 100 workers), likely due to a concentration of labor-intensive industries. In contrast, Colorado has the lowest rate (5.5 per 100 workers), possibly reflecting stronger workplace safety regulations or a higher proportion of office-based jobs.\nFalls represent a major cost driver in both settings, but office falls (same level + slips) account for 21.2% of fall-related costs, compared to 9.8% for non-office falls. This highlights the financial burden of seemingly minor but frequent office accidents.",

These could include routine maintenance of flooring and employee education around slip and trip hazards.\nRegion-Specific Safety Assessments: Despite the lack of statistically significant regional differences, variation still exists at the state level. Businesses should consider conducting local assessments to tailor safety interventions to the specific risks and needs of each region.\n\n\n\n\n\n“Amazon Is Fined Nearly $6 Million Over Warehouse Work Quotas - The New York Times.” n.d.
