# Recommendations

Based on the findings, I recommend the following:

-   **Enhance Fall Prevention in Office Settings:** Given the high proportion of fall-related costs in office environments, companies should invest in targeted fall prevention programs. These could include routine maintenance of flooring and employee education around slip and trip hazards.

-   **Conduct Region-Specific Safety Assessments:** Despite the lack of statistically significant regional differences, variation still exists at the state level. Businesses should consider conducting local assessments to tailor safety interventions to the specific risks and needs of each region.
