# Introduction

In 2023, Amazon was fined \$7,000 by OSHA following the death of a warehouse worker linked to unsafe conditions @staffFortWayneAmazon2023. The company also faced a \$60,000 penalty for exposing employees to additional hazards @palmerAmazonCitedLabor2023, and has been the subject of over 50 OSHA investigations since 2020, with fines totaling more than \$6 million @AmazonFinedNearly. These incidents emphasize the real costs of workplace injuries, where employers face not only human tragedy but also legal liability and reputational damage. Nationally, U.S. businesses lose an estimated \$167 billion annually due to workplace injuries @WorkInjuryCosts.

While industrial settings often dominate safety conversations, office environments are frequently overlooked, despite accounting for 23.9% of preventable injury costs. This report explores whether office workers face greater injury risks than non-office workers, particularly in terms of injury frequency and cost. Using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, I analyzed injury trends across workplace types and regions, identifying the most costly injury types, and examining where injury rates are highest.

Findings revealed that while non-office settings have higher overall injury rates, office environments experience a disproportionate share of same-level falls, responsible for 17.2% of total injury costs. These results suggest that companies should reallocate safety resources toward office settings, possibly reducing liability exposure and overall costs despite common assumptions that non-office settings are riskier.
