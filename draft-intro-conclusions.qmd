# Introduction

In 2023, Amazon was fined \$7,000 by OSHA following the death of a warehouse worker linked to unsafe conditions (@StaffFortWayneAmazon). The company also faced a \$60,000 penalty for exposing employees to additional hazards (@PalmerAmazonCitedLabor), and has been the subject of over 50 OSHA investigations since 2020, with fines totaling more than \$6 million (@AmazonFinedNearly). These incidents emphasize the real costs of workplace injuries, where employers face not only human tragedy but also legal liability and reputational damage. Nationally, U.S. businesses lose an estimated \$167 billion annually due to workplace injuries (@WorkInjuryCosts).

While industrial settings often dominate safety conversations, office environments are frequently overlooked, despite accounting for 23.9% of preventable injury costs. This report explores whether office workers face greater injury risks than non-office workers, particularly in terms of injury frequency and cost. Using Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data, I analyzed injury trends across workplace types and regions, identifying the most costly injury types, and examining where injury rates are highest.

Findings revealed that while non-office settings have higher overall injury rates, office environments experience a disproportionate share of same-level falls, responsible for 17.2% of total injury costs. These results suggest that companies should reallocate safety resources toward office settings, possibly reducing liability exposure and overall costs despite common assumptions that non-office settings are riskier.

# Conclusion

This analysis examined injury costs and risks in both office and non-office environments, as well as regional variations in injury rates. The findings show that office environments account for 23.9% of injury costs, while non-office environments contribute 30.8%. Falls are the leading cause of injury in both environments, with office settings bearing a disproportionate share of fall-related costs at 21.2%, compared to 9.8% in non-office environments. Although regional injury rates varied, ANOVA results indicated no statistically significant differences. Maine had the highest injury rate, while Colorado had the lowest. Additionally, the correlation analysis showed no meaningful relationship between injury volume and injury rate.

While informative, this study has limitations, primarily due to the scope and limitations of publicly available data. The dataset may not fully capture unreported incidents, variations in workplace practices across industries, or inconsistencies in data collection. Future research could assess the effectiveness of safety policies, the quality of their implementation, and other factors influencing injury rates. Expanding the dataset to include more variables and detailed industry breakdowns would offer a more comprehensive understanding of injury risks.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, I recommend the following:

-   **Fall Prevention in Office Settings:** Given the high proportion of fall-related costs in office environments, companies should invest in targeted fall prevention programs. These could include routine maintenance of flooring and employee education around slip and trip hazards.

-   **Region-Specific Safety Assessments:** Despite the lack of statistically significant regional differences, variation still exists at the state level. Businesses should consider conducting local assessments to tailor safety interventions to the specific risks and needs of each region.
